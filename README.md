This game was developed as a personal project to compete with friends, the main objective was to make a copy of the distinctive game Overcooked but with a cowboy touch. Unity was used as the development platform and the C# programming language was used as the backend. For the design of all the elements of the video game, blender and illustrator were used for the 2D images and textures. The video game was awarded second place in the competition (among friends) which was recognized in local news.

The idea is to make the orders that customers make to the kitchen, at the top will appear the recipes and the quantities of ingredients necessary to make them. For example: When an order for tomato soup is made, 3 tomatoes are needed, so you must go and collect the 3 tomatoes from the vegetable box, then chop them on the boards and then place them in the pot.
